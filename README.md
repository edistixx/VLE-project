The matlab file contains the modelled raoult's law
Simulations are best done within 1,15 and 40 bar
However if any other pressure is used, some codes do not run 
An aspen file is also attached. Simulations can also be done in aspen with any pressure by just using the binary simulation area
where the pressure can be changed
